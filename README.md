## International Debt Analysis
This is a group project created for MSDS 7330 Fall 2017@SMU based on International Debt data available at https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/international-debt-statistics.
## Dataset Info
The International Debt data contains more than 200 debt and financial flows indicators for over 130 countries that report debt to the World Bank reporting system. The database runs from 1970 to 2016 and pipeline data for scheduled debt service payments on existing commitments to 2024. We will be focusing on most recent debt for each country (as of 2016) to answer questions of interest.
## Objective of Project
To analyze the world bank International Debt data and provide the powerful insights by using MySQL on IBM bluemix. We want to analyze which country has the highest and lowest debt. What category of debt is highest across differnt countries. We also want to investigate if the income level has any effect on the overall debt of the country.
